Analysis of my scatter Plot: class vs Malic_acid
The scatter plot shows how Malic_acid values change across three classes:

Class #1: Values are very close between 1 and 2.

Class #2: Values are more spread out, in the range of 1 to 6.

Class #3: Similar to Class 2 but more densely clustered above 3.
my Insights:
The relationship is non-linear, with clear clustering for each class.
we can understand from this that  Malic_acid can help distinguish between classes and may be useful for future classification tasks.
